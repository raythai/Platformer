# Platformer
A simple platformer started to learn how to program video games. 
This program is done in java
Level design and block sheet are my original creation.
Character sprite was generated from http://gaurav.munjal.us/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/
Only minor tweeks were done to character sprites to fit into this program.
